# File System #
Samuel Thorson and Luke Lopata

## Implementation ##
- Our implementation completes the functions within fs.c to allow for operations to occur on a simulated file system.
- Follows the guidelines provided in the project 4 writeup.

## Testing ##
- Our tests cover a wide range of edge cases and disk sizes to ensure proper error handling and general functionality.<br/>
- Our tests can be found in the script 'project4/testfunctions.sh'. To replicate our testing, run the script with the commands:
<br/>
``` ./testfunctions.sh ```
<br/> 
- Running this script will automatically run all the tests and print everything to the terminal. If you wish to redirect to a log file use 
```./testfunctions.sh | tee log.txt ```
- All outputs of the edge case checking can be found in this file.
